- Finish integrating ppmcaption by stopping making ppms in font.cc
  and make xwds instead and remove ppm.cc

- Migrate font.cc to c++ by making it a class ; it is now still C despite name
- Pull the font and fontpath back out of the xwd class

- isolate usage msg strings so they can be all presented in -help

- Document option use in README

- Add margin around banners/text and settable in pixels or characters

- Add automatic margin sizing and shrink-wrapping based on the font's 
  width and height so as to make the making of banners a single-option 
  command / easy uncomplicated thing to do

- Make sure all options are consistent for example -resize expects to be 
  followed by W and H but -text expects -x and -y settings to preceed it
