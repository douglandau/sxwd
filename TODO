  TODO LIST

- Fix font reading.  I don't remember where I got the fonts last time
  but this time it's puking on fonts with >256 glyphs, which is all of
  them it seems

- Migrate font.cc to c++ by making it a class ; it is now still C despite name

- Continue to improve usage message, isolate usage msg strings so they can
  be all presented in -help

- Actually document in README

- add margin around banners/text and settable in pixels or characters
