Sxwd is a utility for inspecting and modifying 8-bit pseudocolor (paletted)
XWD images.  It was initially written to deal with colormap issues, for 
example to dump the RGB values, identify/purge duplicate colors, trim or
truncate the colormap, identify the location of black and white, etc. 
Therefore basic operation is:

$ sxwd -in white8.xwd -cmap    
$ sxwd -in white8.xwd -check    
$ sxwd -in white8.xwd -header
$ sxwd -in white8.xwd -addColor DarkSlateBlue -write
$ sxwd -in white8.xwd -check -c16


Many images use less than 256 colors but most programs seem to want to 
write a full 256 cells: 

$ wget http://cloud.insideidaho.org/data/imageryBaseMapsEarthCover/topographicMaps/drg_24k_idaho/46/drg24k_46114a1_usgs.tif
$ mv drg24k_46114a1_usgs.tif o46114a1.tif
$ convert o46114a1.tif o46114a1.xwd
$ sxwd -in o46114a1.xwd -check
$ sxwd -in o46114a1.xwd -cmap
$ sxwd -in o46114a1.xwd -c16

We can recover the cells:

$ sxwd -in o46114a1.xwd -over15
$ sxwd -in o46114a1.xwd -trunc 16 -write
$xwd -in o46114a1.xwd -check -c16


If we have two images we wish to combine, we could concatenate their
colormaps together blindly, we could merge them or attempt to merge them,
or we could remap the colors in one of them to those in the other.

$ ./sxwd -in o38119h8.xwd -patch doug.xwd -x 100 -y 100 -write
$ ./sxwd -in o38119h8.xwd -patchCentered doug.xwd -x 100 -y 100 -write
$ ./sxwd -in o38119h8.xwd -mapTo o38119a1.xwd -write

Some other basic features include getting and setting pixels, drawing 
lines and rectangles, clipping and resizing.  These are barebones;
there is no pen thickness and no anti-aliasing, the latter leaving the 
-scale option useless.


Lettering was added make banner images more quickly than with mogrify:

$ cp white8.xwd w.xwd
$ ./sxwd -in w.xwd -resize 5000 1000 -set -write
$ ./sxwd -in w.xwd -fontPath /opt/source/sxwd/X11/fonts/bdf -fontDPI misc -font 7x14 -x 100 -y 100 -alignment Left -text "This is the 7x14 font"   -write
