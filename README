Sooper-xwd


I   Overview

Sxwd is a swiss army knife for dealing with xwd images.  Xwd is a
C++ class which was created by merging xwd.c and xwud.c from the
X11R6 distribution and porting them to g++.  Sxwd is a command line
wrapper to exercise the member functions of xwd.

A few additional features have been added.  Line drawing was taken
from "Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice" by Foley and Van Dam 
and text rendering was taken from ppmcaption-1.0 by Jamie Zawinski.
